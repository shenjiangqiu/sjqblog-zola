in rust.\nA good resource to learn: the async book\nthis post shares my understanding of async in Rust.\n🐼async trait\nan async block in Rust is a type that implements the `Future`` trait. so what is a future?\n\nSo a future can be polled and return a Poll type. Poll is an enum type:\n\nSo a future basically means a function that can be polled multiple times, and It can say that I'm ready or I'm not ready. If it's ready, it will return a Ready with the result, otherwise, it will return a Pending and the executor will call it again later.\nSo when will the executor call it again? The executor will call it again when the future is ready to be polled again. So how does the executor know when the future is ready to be polled again? when the executor called the poll, it will pass a waker inside the context to the Future, and when the Future is ready to be polled again, it will call the waker to wake the executor: waker.wake(). So the executor will call the poll again.\n🐼async/await, async block\nlet's look at an async block: note that all code is handwritten, not compiled. ignore some syntax errors~~\n\nthe rust compiler will compile the my_task to a state machine that implements the `Future`` trait. we can assume that it looks like this(ignore the syntax errors~~):\n\nwe can see that, the async block is equivalent to a state machine, and the Future trait is the interface of the state machine. the poll function is the state transition function of the state machine. the waker is the state transition trigger of the state machine.\nwhen the executor first calls the poll function, the state machine will start from the first state, and when the state machine is ready to be polled again, it will call the waker to wake the executor, and the executor will call the poll function again, and the state machine will continue to run.\n🐼why use Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt; instead of &amp;mut Self in poll function?\nbefore talking about this question, let's talk about Pin first. if we have a mutable reference, we can easily move the value that the reference point by mem::swawp. most time that's ok, but when the struct is self-referenced, it will cause problems. for example(note: this code is not compiled in safe rust, just ignore the syntax errors):\n\nusually, we cannot have a struct that contains self-reference, but in the async block, the self-reference struct is common, for example:\n\nthe above future might stop at the some_future state, and the some_future state is self-referenced. so if we use &amp;mut self in the poll function, we can easily cause the self-reference problem. so the rust compiler uses Pin to solve this problem. Pin is a pointer that can't be moved, so we can use Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt; instead of &amp;mut Self to avoid the self-reference problem.\nextra: what if Pin&lt;&amp;mut T&gt; and T are not self-referenced? In this case, we should be ok to use &amp;mut T, but the rust compiler use Pin&lt;&amp;mut T&gt; to make the code more general. Do we have a way to get a &amp;mut T? The answer is yes, we can use Pin::get_mut to get a &amp;mut T from a Pin&lt;&amp;mut T&gt; if the T is UnPin. The future trait does not know the exact type of the future, so it needs to use Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt; to make the code more general. but in our implementation of the future trait, we can use Pin::get_mut to get a &amp;mut T if the T is UnPin.\nread pin to learn more about Pin. pin;\n","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/async-rust/","title":""},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/books/":{"body":"","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/books/","title":""},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/books/intro-algo/":{"body":"\nlink\n\nthis book includes all the concepts of algorithms.\n1.

Since the size of a sense\namplifier is larger than a cell , modern DRAM designs\naccommodate only as many as sense amplifiers in a row to\nsense half a row of cells. To sense the entire row of cells,\neach subarray has bitlines that connect two rows of sense\namplifiers, one above and one below the subarray.\nAs a side benefit, mat interleaving and subarray interleaving make the memory more robust against multiple-bit upset,\nwhere soft errors change the value of adjacent cells. In fact, when bits in a column are not physically close to each other, multiple-bit upset only changes one bit from a column and then error detection mechanisms (which can detect one error) can detect the error.\nTherefore, keeping the current interleaving and not changing the layout is desirable.\nHowever, with interleaving, row-wide computation on\nmore than 4-bit values is impractical, as the result of an addition and multiplication in each 4 bits of the output depends\non the values in other mats. With row-wide operations, the\ncircuits for reuniting the interleaved bits impose a significant\nhardware overhead as many wires cross each other.\n\n\nmat interleaving:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfulcrum design:\n\n\nreuniting interleaved bits:\n\n\n\n\n\nthe walkers:\n\n\nHence, we introduced\ncolumn-selection latches where we store the one-hot-encoded\nvalue of a column and shift the value to access the next col-\numn, without requiring one column decoder per Walker, per\nsubarray, and per mat.\n\nthe controller:\n\na 6-bit counter per Walker\nfor detecting a fully-accessed Walker\nEach Walker has a 2-bit latch that determines to which Walker\nwe should switch and rename when the Walker is fully ac-\ncessed (elaborated in Section 5.1.6),\na 4-bit counter for counting\nthe wait time for a new row to be read from the subarray and\nbe stored in a Walker, or for a Walker to be written to the\nsubarray,\nthree 11-bit (11 = log 2 of the number of\nrows in each pair of subarrays (2048)) row counters which are\ninitialized to the row address of the beginning of the data and\nwill be compared against the end of the data in the subarray.\n\n\n\n\n\ngearbox architechture:\nSPMSPV walk through:\n\nstep 1: FrontierDistribution:\n\n\nIn iterative applications, the frontier is generated in previous iterations and already resides in subarrays in which their\ncorresponding columns reside, except for the output entries that\ncorrespond to long row/columns, which reside in the logic layer. At\nthe start of each iteration, we broadcast the entries residing in the\nlogic layer to all subarrays and append them to the frontier array\nin each subarray.\n\nthe frontier is generated by shared frontier in logic layer and the local frontier.\n\nstep 2: offset packing:\n\n\nThis step packs the column offset, col-\numn length, and the values from the frontier array that should be\nmultiplied in the column into a new array. Figure 10 shows the\npseudo-code of this step.\n\n\n\n\nput the index, lengh and value into a new array.\n\nstep3: localAccumulations:\n\n\nThis step multiplies each value of\nthe frontier with its corresponding column. Figure 11 demonstrates\nthe pseudo-code of this step. In this step, if a clean value is being\nupdated, the clean value indicator and its row index will be sent to\nthe Dispatcher.\n\n\n\nstep4: Dispatching:\n\n\nIn this step, the Dispatcher sends all the\nstored entries (index-value pairs) to their destination subarrays.\nHere, the Dispatcher’s Walker acts as a buffer.\n\n\nstep5: RemoteAccumulations:\n\n\nIn this step, the SPU sequentially processes index-value pairs received in the previous step and\nperforms the accumulations. Also, in this step, if the value in the\nindex-value pair is a clean-value indicator, the index of clean-value\nis appended to the corresponding array\n\n\nstep6: applying:\n\n\nThis step processes the array containing the non-zero indexes to generate the frontier for the next iteration, initializes\nthe output vector to clean indicators, and sends long-activating\nentries to the logic layer to be reduced and applied there. It also\nperforms the apply operation 𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 [:] = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 [:] + 𝛼𝑦 [:],\nwhich is explained in Section 2.\n\nsummary of the gearbox:\n\n\nthe frontier: $$F[0]$$ is the input index, $$F[1]$$ is the input value ,for each frontier, get the pack, $$P[0]$$ is the matrix b index, $$P[1]$$ is the matrix b len, $$P[2]$$ is the value of the frontier.\n\n\nlocal: for each value in P, the P[0] is used as offset to find the correct row, store F_value, len, offset in PE. go throught the row, for each element in the row CSC_pair[0] is row index, CSC_pair[1] is the value, Output[RowId] += F_value *

simultaneously?\n\n\nicnt and tsv details(port, route): not mentioned in paper\n\nthe control flow mechanism?\nthere are multiple subarrays sending and multiple subarrays receiving(80000), how the subarrays know that all other subarrays have finished sending and receiving?\n\n\n\nthe designe of async spmspm(our work)\nmotivation:\n\nthe bottlenech for spmspm of each task is not banlance, if no async, each task's time will be decided by the slowest subarray inside that task. when async is enabled, the time will be decide by slowest subarray with accumulated time.\n\ndescription of the design:\nto support async remote dispatcher, there are several challenges:\n\nwhen sending the remote traffic, all local subarray should be stoped because the dispatcher will be in sending mode and cannot serve the local traffic.\nwhen receiving the remove traffic, the local subarray should be stoped because the dispatcher will be in receiving mode and cannot serve the local traffic.\nwhen update the dense result, the local subarray ???\nwe should send the remote traffic to a buffer for reducing interupts to the working subarray.\nwhen start to send the traffic to remote, there should be a flow-control mechanism to avoid the deadlock.\nthe buffer management should be carefully designed to save space.\n\ndesigns:\n\nwhen local dispatcher find TODO number of traffic, it will start to send it to the buffer inside this die\nthen the die buffer find TODO number of traffic for some destination, it will start to send it to the remote die\nwhen the remote die recieved enough traffic, it will send a signal of some bank, make the bank to become recieving mode. and send all traffic to the bank.\nbefore start sending eveything, the subarray, die buffer will need to acuire a lock first to ensure that there will be no deadlock in ring and the buffer will not be full.\n\nthe buffer design:\n\ntodo: how to partition the buffer, the buffer should be worked as a queue, there are two choice:\n\nstore all traffic in one unified buffer, when the traffic is full, stop recieving traffic, scan the packages and decide which package are going to be send to the remote: problem: if only a part of the traffic will be able to send. how to fix the hole in the queue.\nstore the traffic in several buffers, each buffer is a queue for a dedicated destination. problem: how to partition the space. if all traffic is of one channel, then the buffer will be underutilized.\n\n\ntodo: when to trigger buffer sending. problem: if the buffer of the source die is full, the traffic may not able to be send because there are no enough space in the remote die. two choice: the remote die will send the final update as soon as possible. or there should be a communication mechanism between the source die and the remote die to ensure that the remote die will have enough space to store the traffic.\ntodo: how to manage the icnt traffic flow control: link\n\nthe buffer in logic die:\n\npartition the buffer:\n\nthe traffic coming from the source die will be forwarded to the target die, target bank, if we should partition the buffer into servral parts\"\n\nper bank\nper die\n\n\ndo not partition the buffer, use the unified buffer\n\n\nTODO, how to trigger sending\n\nthe package sending design of source subarray:\nthe dispatcher will send the traffic.\nproblem:\n\nwhen the dispatcher is recieving traffic, there should be 3 types of traffic:\n\nsame bank\ndifferent bank, same die\ndifferent die\n\n\nwhen handle the traffic, if simply send all traffic to the buffer. the size of the queue may be too large, because the type 1,2 not need to be there.\n\nTODO solution:\n\n(TODO) solution1: when the dispatcher is full, directly send the traffic to the local bank, but send the traffic to the layer buffer for type 2,3\n(TODO) solution2: when the dispatcher is full, scan the packages, send signal to the banks that should receive the traffic, and make the banks ready. directly send type2 to bank, only send type3 to the buffer\n(TOOD) solution3: send all traffic to the buffer. only send the traffic when the buffer is triggered to send.\n\nthe package update design of destination subarray:\nthe subarray will recieve the remote traffic.\nproblem:\n\nwhen recieve the traffic, should the bank immediatly update the destination?\n\nif yes, all subarray should be stoped and the walkers may need to be reset to be ready to write.\nif no, (TODO) seems no benifit because the subarray still need to stop.\n\n\n\nTODO solution:\n\n(TODO), because the gearbox paper do not have details of dense write. so we do not know how to do it.\n\nmiscs:\n\n(TODO) how to handle and when to transfore the dense formate to sparse formate.\n(TODO) When perform the transfomation, the subarray should be stoped, and the walker should be reset to be ready to

The performance is limited by two factors: the peak performance of the processor and the memory bandwidth of the system. These two limitations are represented by two diagonal lines on the graph, which create a triangle called the \"roofline\".\nTo optimize performance, application developers must find ways to increase operational intensity so that the code operates closer to or above the roofline.

Different types of vertices and\nedges in a heterogeneous graph have different dimensions\non their features.\nMetapath-based Aggregation. Traditional GNNs directly aggregate information based on the vertex’s neighbors, while\nHGNNs leverage metapath instances to aggregate richer\nstructural and semantic information.\nMulti-level Aggregation. Traditional GNNs contain only one\naggregation and one combination in each layer. HGNNs\ninclude structural (intra-metapath) and semantic aggregation\n(inter-metapath).\n\nthe workflow of METANMP\nit use roofline-model to find the bottleneck of the model, and then optimize the bottleneck. We can see that both structural aggregation and semantic aggregation are memory bottlenecks, except for the feature projection being compute-intensive\n3.1 Metapath Instance Generation via Cartesian\n3.2 Relevant Metapath Instance Awareness\n\n\nRedundant Computation Elimination.\n\nWhen a vertex in the\ndefined metapath has multiple type-matched neighbors, it scatters\nout multiple metapath instances that exist redundant computation\namong them. For example, ②-③ is sub-metapath instance for metapath A-B-A in Figure 6. The vertex ③ has three type-A neighbors,\nso it can generate three instances, all of which contain redundant\ncomputations for aggregating the vertices ② and ③. If we aggregate each instance independently, it is difficult to capture these\nredundant computations, requiring significant detection overhead.\nTo efficiently eliminate redundant aggregation of these relevant\ninstances, we use a simple yet effective relevant instance-aware approach where each instance can be naturally exploited for shareable\ncomputation during metapath instance generation. We inspect all\ndependencies (a dependency contains at least two vertices) starting\nfrom vertices of the first type in the metapath, and vertices on a dependency are aggregated directly. Once multiple sub-dependencies\nare scattered from a dependency, that is, multiple instances are\ngenerated. The previously aggregated result can be shared by these\nmetapath instances. We further illustrate this with the example\nin Figure 6. At the beginning, we inspect all dependencies along\nthe vertex ②. The vertex ③ is a path along the vertex ② out of\nthe match type (③ and ② form a dependency), and we complete\nthe vertex aggregation on them. When we then match vertex ③’s\ntype-matched neighbor vertices along the metapath, we find that\nit has multiple type-matched neighbors, which results in multiple\nmetapath instances and brings shareable aggregation computation\nopportunity. The result of previous aggregation is then shared to\nthese metapath instances.\n\nInstance-driven Aggregation.\n\nExisting methods construct subgraphs to represent relevant metapath instances for each vertex\nby pre-processing. They ignore the information carried by the instance itself. The first vertex of each meta-path instance implicitly\nindicates which vertex they belong to. Therefore, instead of aggregating these related metapath instances using the gather-centered\napproach based on subgraphs, it is more efficient to drive the aggregation by metapath instance itself\n3.3 Near-Memory Processing\nmy example of graph\n\n\n\n\nthe graph:\n\n\n\nfrist round it will generate these instance:\n(a1,a2) - b1 - (c1,c2) = (a1 - b1 - c1),(a1 - b1 - c2),(a2 - b1 - c1),(a2 - b1 - c2)\n(a3) - b2 - (c3)\n(a2) - b3 - (c2)\nthere are total 6 instance, 3 in the frist dimm, 3 in the second dimm,marked as t1-t6\nt1 = (a1 - b1 - c1)\nt2 = (a1 - b1 - c2)\nt3 = (a2 - b1 - c1)\nt4 = (a2 - b1 - c2)\nt5 = (a3 - b2 - c3)\nt6 = (a2 - b3 - c2)\nwhen go to stage 2 there need some computation:\nthe core vertex is now d1,d1,d3,\n(t1,t2,t3,t4,t6) - d1 - e1\n(t1,t3,t5) - d2 - e2\n(t1,t3,t5) - d3 - e3\n\n\nthe analysis\n\nhow to find the related t when make d as the core vertex?\nin this paper, this is not mentioned, we can assume a simple method: to create a vertual node named T and creat the vertual edge between T and D.\nso the question is: how and when to create the edge, and what infomation needed? we can create the edge when we create the instance. like when we create the instance t1 = (a1 - b1 -c1), we go through the edge list of all c1's neighbors, and add the instance address and the start vertex(a1) to the edge list. the address is used to load the data, the start vertex is used to decide which DIMM to load the data.

The private key is kept secret, and the public key is distributed to anyone who needs to send you encrypted messages.\n🐼the ssh login process\nThe ssh login process is as follows:\n\nstage 1, key exchange: the client and server decide a common shared secret key for further communication.\nThe basis of this procedure for classic Diffie-Hellman are:\n\n\nBoth parties agree on a large prime number, which will serve as a seed value.\nBoth parties agree on an encryption generator (typically AES), which will be used to manipulate the values in a predefined way.\nIndependently, each party comes up with another prime number which is kept secret from the other party. This number is used as the private key for this interaction (different from the private SSH key used for authentication).\nThe generated private key, the encryption generator, and the shared prime number are used to generate a public key that is derived from the private key, but which can be shared with the other party.\nBoth participants then exchange their generated public keys.\nThe receiving entity uses their own private key, the other party’s public key, and the original shared prime number to compute a shared secret key. Although this is independently computed by each party, using opposite private and public keys, it will result in the same shared secret key.\nThe shared secret is then used to encrypt all communication that follows.\n\n\nstage 2, authentication, all traffic will be encrypted after the key exchange:\n\n\nthe client sends a public key to the server.\nthe server sends a challenge to the client using the public key of the client.\nthe client decrypts the challenge using the private key of the client.\nthe server compares the decrypted challenge with the challenge it sent to the client. if they are the same, the server can proceed to the next step.\n\n\nstage 3, communication:\n\n\nthe client and the server can send regular message using the shared secret key.\n\n","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/ssh-login/","title":""},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/ssh/":{"body":"there are several protocal RFCs for ssh,\n\nrfc 4251 is the main Architecture for ssh.\nrfc 4253 is the Transport Layer RFC for ssh.\nrfc 4252 is the Authentication RFC for ssh.\nrfc 4254 is the Connection Protocal\n\n","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/ssh/","title":""},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/tokio/":{"body":"🐼runtime parts\nthere are three parts in the runtime.\n🐼scheduler\n🐼handle\n🐼blocking_pool\n","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/tokio/","title":""},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/welcome/":{"body":"Welcome! this blog is build with Zola, a static site generator written in rust.\nPlease check the subsections here for more posts!the subsections: posts ..\n","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/welcome/","title":""},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/tags/":{"body":"","id":"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/tags/","title":""}},"docInfo":{"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/about/":{"body":20,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/async-rust/":{"body":322,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/books/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/books/intro-algo/":{"body":10,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/chat-tokio/":{"body":31,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/daily/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/daily/prefill-generation/":{"body":284,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/daily/soft-instinfer/":{"body":134,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/interesting-lifetime-problems/":{"body":22,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/life/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/life/cmd-tools/":{"body":102,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/life/github-action/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/life/the-good-websites/":{"body":35,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/linux-boot/":{"body":7,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/openroad-flow/":{"body":19,"title":3},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/gearbox-walk/":{"body":33,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/generative-accelerators/":{"body":495,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/gpt-todo/":{"body":37,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/hetero-graph/":{"body":11,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/path/":{"body":28,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/pim-design/":{"body":1004,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/rethink-spmspm/":{"body":154,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/roofline-model/":{"body":95,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/research/thinking-in-hgnn/":{"body":583,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/russh/":{"body":150,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/rust-tips/":{"body":78,"title":2},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/ssh-login/":{"body":284,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/ssh/":{"body":24,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/tokio/":{"body":8,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/posts/welcome/":{"body":17,"title":0},"https://shenjiangqiu.github.io/sjqblog-zola/tags/":{"body":0,"title":0}},"length":34},"lang":"English"}
