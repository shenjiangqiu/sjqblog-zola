The roofline model is a performance modeling technique used to analyze and optimize the performance of parallel computing systems. It gives a visual representation of the performance limitations of the system and helps identify potential opportunities for optimization.

The model plots the performance in GFLOPs per second on the y-axis and the operational intensity in bytes per FLOP on the x-axis. The performance is limited by two factors: the peak performance of the processor and the memory bandwidth of the system. These two limitations are represented by two diagonal lines on the graph, which create a triangle called the "roofline".

To optimize performance, application developers must find ways to increase operational intensity so that the code operates closer to or above the roofline. This can be achieved through techniques such as data reuse, loop tiling, and algorithmic optimization.

Overall, the roofline model is a useful tool for understanding the performance characteristics of a system and developing strategies to optimize it.
