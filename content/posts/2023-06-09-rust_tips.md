### the data isolation of struct
there is a post in reddit: [Problematic pattern I've encountered a few times now...](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1440094/problematic_pattern_ive_encountered_a_few_times/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), first let's look at the code:

```rust
struct Foo {
    items: Vec<u32>,
}

impl Foo {
    fn run_all(&mut self) {
        for item in &self.items {
            self.run_one(item);
        }
    }
    
    fn run_one(&mut self, item: &u32) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
the `self.run_one(item)` will take a reference of item as well as a &mut self, which violates the rule: you can't have a mutable reference and a immutable reference at the same time.
how to solve this problem? the problems is obvious: when can `run_one`, we have a `&mut self` which could change the `self.items`, that might cause the `item` to be invalid. so we need to make sure that `run_one` will not change `self.items`. the solution is isolate the data that run_one might change. so we can change the code to:

```rust
struct Foo {
    state: StuffToUpdate,
    items: Vec<u32>,
}

struct StuffToUpdate {
    /// ...
}

impl Foo {
    // NOTE take by ownership!
    fn run_all(&mut self)  {
        // EDIT: forgot to actually... loop.
        for item in &self.items {
            state.run_one(items);
        }
    }
}

impl StuffToUpdate {
    fn run_one(&mut self, item: &u32) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

nice job, run_one will only change the state of StuffToUpdate, and we move run one to StuffToUpdate to make sure it cannot change the items.
